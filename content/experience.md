# 💼 Experience

**Northwestern University & Abbott**, Evanston, IL  
*Assistant Research Algorithm Engineer · Deep Learning–based PII/PHI Anonymization*  
*09/2025 – 12/2025*  
- Designed and implemented a **hybrid anonymization framework** integrating *regex-based entity detection* and *language model–driven contextual replacement*, achieving accurate and consistent PII/PHI anonymization in unstructured text.  
- Optimized model accuracy and memory usage to enable **real-time anonymization** and efficient local deployment.  

**IFLYTEK Co.**, Hefei, China  
*Assistant Research Algorithm Engineer · Human Pose Estimation and Cooperative Liveness Detection*  
*10/2023 – 01/2024*  
- Optimized the *Top-Down Residual Log-likelihood Estimation (RLE)* algorithm, fine-tuned parameters to improve **facial keypoint detection** for cabin DMS scenarios, increasing accuracy by 8%.  
- Developed a **Cooperative Liveness Detection Algorithm** using keypoint and head pose estimation for banking systems, reducing false rates by 20% and latency under 100 ms.  
- Applied the *Bottom-Up KAPAO framework* to facial keypoint prediction in cabin OMS, significantly improving multi-person detection performance.  

**Chinese Academy of Sciences**, Hefei, China  
*Research Assistant · Medical Image Recognition*  
*06/2023 – 09/2023*  
- Developed a **modified CenterNet model** to detect and sequentially label spinal joints (L1–L5) on CT images.  
- Introduced a new center representation emphasizing critical regions and spatial priors of human vertebrae.  
- Achieved a 13.6% improvement in AP on the CM dataset and published an SCI paper *“Exploring Neighbor Spatial Relationships for Enhanced Lumbar Vertebrae Detection in X-ray Images.”*
